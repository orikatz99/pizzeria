## Pizzeria Management System 🍕 
This is my final project for the Systems Programming course in C, completed on behalf of Afka College.  
I chose to develop a pizza management system.  
The user will load an existing pizzeria from a text or binary file, including its name and address, and will be able to place orders.  
The pizzeria has a list of club members who can use and accumulate points.  
There is also a list of coupons that provide additional discounts.  
In addition, there is a menu where each pizza has a different price based on its size, dough type, and toppings.

A complete description of the system exists, including all its features and special operations.

You are welcome to run the code and evaluate it.
